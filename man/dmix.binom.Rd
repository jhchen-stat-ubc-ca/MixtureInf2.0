\title{dmix.binom}
\usage{
dmix.binom(x, size, alpha, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector at which the probability mass function is evaluated.}

\item{size}{The number of trials.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of the mixing probabilities.}

\item{theta}{A vector of the probabilities of success of each component.}
}
\description{
This function computes the probability mass function points in x.
}
\note{
In order to plot the mixture density together with its subpopulation density, one can use the plotmix.binom function.
}
\examples{
alpha = c(.5, .1, .4)
theta = c(.1, .35, .8)
size = 25
x = rmix.binom(1000, size, alpha, theta)
dmix.binom(x,size,alpha,theta)
