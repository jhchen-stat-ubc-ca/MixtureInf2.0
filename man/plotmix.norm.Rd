\usage{
plotmix.norm(
  x = NULL,
  xx.grid = NULL,
  alpha,
  mu,
  sigma,
  m0,
  k = 20,
  extra.height = 1.05,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The input data that can be either a vector or a matrix with the 1st column being the observed values
and the 2nd column being the corresponding frequency.}

\item{xx.grid}{The grid of the histogram.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of the mixing proportions.}

\item{mu}{A vector of the component means.}

\item{sigma}{A vector of the component standard deviations.}

\item{m0}{The order of the finite mixture model.}

\item{k}{The number of bars for the histogram.}

\item{extra.height}{Additional height multiplier used to enlarge the plot vertically.}

\item{comp}{A parameter for the compontent fitted density. 
comp=T means component fitted densities are drawn, and comp=F means no component fitted densities.}

\item{hist.ind}{It is ture if there's data to be used to plot the histogram.}

\item{main}{The title of the graph.}

\item{xlab}{The label for the x-axis}

\item{ylab}{The label for the y-axis}
}
\value{
It returns the histogram of observations and the plot of the fitted density
}
