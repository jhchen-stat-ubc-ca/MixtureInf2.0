This data set contains the number of major earthquakes (magnitude 7 or greater) in the world from
1900 to 2006. The data are available in Table 1.1 of Zucchini & MacDonald (2009). Zucchini &
MacDonald (2009) suggested using a Poisson mixture model to fit the data. The data frame has 107
rows and 1 column.
